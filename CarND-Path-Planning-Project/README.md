# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

### Drive Without  Incident
The car was able to driver over 15 miles without incident.

### Drive Below Speed Limit
The car never goes over the speed limit.

### Max Acceleration and Jerk Not Exceeded
The maximum acceleration and jerk were not exceeded for over 15 miles.

### No Collisions
No collisions.

### Car Stays in Lane, Except When Changing Lanes
The car does stay in it's own lane except when changing lanes.

### The Care is Able to Change Lanes
The car is able to change lanes.  I wish there was more time to explore functionality such as requiring a smaller gap when cars are driving at similar speeds and slowing down in order to make a "2 lane" change.

#  Reflection
The process of path planning can be broken down into 3 primary steps; Analyze Other Cars, Path Planning and Trajectory Calculation.  You first determine which cars are near you and pose a danger of collision, or otherwise may affect your path.  Based on the data you can then determine the best path to take, maximizing speed when possible, while also avoiding contact with other cars.  Finally, the trajectory is planned.  A nice plugin called spline makes this task significantly easier to achieve.

## Analyze Other Cars
Starting at line 122 in the code, I used sensor fusion data to analyze the location of other cars.  There are 3 steps to analyzing the cars:
1. Determine which lane the other cars are in.
2. Check the XY location of the other car.
3. Based on readings from step #2, determine the following:
	a. Is the left lane, relative to my position, safe for passing.
	b. Is the right lane, relative to my position, safe for passing.
	c. Do I need to slow down in order to avoid a collision with any cars that are in my lane.  If so, determine how fast we need to slow down, increasing our braking if the car is getting too close.

When determining if the left and/or right lanes are safe for passing, I look both at cars ahead of me as well as cars behind me.

## Path Planning
After analyzing the location of other cars, I then determine the proper course of action to take if the car in front of me is too close.  This part of the code is in lines 191 - 214.  I take one of 3 courses of action when the car in front of me is getting too close:
1. Change lanes to the left.
2. Change lanes to the right.
3. Slow down.

The final piece to path planning is to determine what to do if the car in front of me is not too close.  The following options can be taken:
1. First check to see if we are at maximum speed.  If not, increase my speed.
2. Next check to make sure we are not going faster than the speed limit.  I set the maximum value at 49.8 so that we can move around the track as fast as possible without going over the speed limit.

## Trajectory Calculation
Beginning at line 228, I set the trajectory for the car based on data from above.

The trajectory is based on the speed and lane decisions that were determined in the Path Planning phase.  It also takes into account the path points used earlier.

The last points of the previous trajectory are used in conjunction with three points at a farther distance to initialize the spine calculation.  If we are just starting out we base it on the cars position, since there is little or no history.

The coordinates are then tranformed to the local car coordinates to be used with the spline calculation.

For this part, I used the code provided in the project review.

### Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/T3_v1.2).  

To run the simulator on Mac/Linux, first make the binary file executable with the following command:
```shell
sudo chmod u+x {simulator_file_name}
```

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!


## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
